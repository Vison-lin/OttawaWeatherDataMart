# OttawaWeatherDataMart

In this project, I analyzed the locations and weathers where traffic accidences occurred in Ottawa, Toronto, and Calgary, respectively. I designed and constructed a DataMart using PostgreSQL respecting the Star Schema. I wrote a Python script using Pandas in order to collect and clean the data, wrote several OLAP Queries to grow comprehension on the data, and performed data visualization using Tableau.
